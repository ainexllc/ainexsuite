## Context Injection Patterns

### Fetching User Data for Context

```typescript
// packages/ai/src/use-grok-assistant.ts
async function buildContext(appName: string, userId: string) {
  switch (appName) {
    case 'notes':
      const notes = await getRecentNotes(userId, 10);
      const labels = await getUserLabels(userId);
      return {
        noteCount: notes.length,
        recentNotes: notes.map(n => ({ title: n.title, preview: n.body.slice(0, 100) })),
        userLabels: labels
      };

    case 'journal':
      const entries = await getRecentEntries(userId, 7);
      const moods = await getMoodPatterns(userId, 30);
      return {
        journalStreak: calculateStreak(entries),
        recentEntries: entries,
        moodPatterns: moods
      };

    // ... other apps
  }
}
```

### Dynamic Prompt Generation

```typescript
function generateSystemPrompt(appName: string, context: any, user: any): string {
  const basePrompt = SYSTEM_PROMPTS[appName];

  return basePrompt
    .replace('{userId}', user.uid)
    .replace('{userName}', user.displayName || 'there')
    .replace('{userEmail}', user.email)
    .replace('{currentDate}', new Date().toLocaleDateString())
    .replace('{recentNotes}', JSON.stringify(context.recentNotes, null, 2))
    .replace('{userLabels}', context.userLabels.join(', '))
    // ... replace all placeholders
    ;
}
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Keep Context Relevant
- Include only data user might reference
- Limit to recent/relevant information
- Don't send entire database

### 2. Protect Privacy
- Never include other users' data
- Sanitize sensitive information
- Respect user preferences

### 3. Optimize Token Usage
- Summarize long content
- Use representative samples
- Trim old context

### 4. Set Clear Boundaries
- Define what AI can and can't do
- Acknowledge limitations
- Provide disclaimers where needed

### 5. Maintain Consistency
- Similar tone across all apps
- Consistent formatting rules
- Unified brand voice

## Testing Prompts

### Test Scenarios

For each app, test with:

1. **Empty State**: User with no data
2. **Basic Usage**: User with minimal data
3. **Power User**: User with lots of data
4. **Edge Cases**: Unusual requests or data

### Example Test Conversations

**Notes App**:
```
User: "Help me organize my notes"
AI: "I can see you have 42 notes. Let me suggest some organization strategies..."

User: "Suggest a title for this note: [content]"
AI: "Based on the content, here are 3 title suggestions..."

User: "Find notes about project X"
AI: "I found 3 notes that mention project X..."
```

## Monitoring & Improvement

### Track Metrics
- Response relevance
- User satisfaction (thumbs up/down)
- Context usage effectiveness
- Token consumption

### Iterate Based on Feedback
- Adjust tone if too formal/casual
- Add capabilities based on requests
- Refine context based on what's useful
- Update guidelines for edge cases
