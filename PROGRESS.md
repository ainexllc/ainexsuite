## 🔑 Technical Architecture

### Authentication Flow
1. User signs in via Main Dashboard
2. Firebase generates session cookie on `.ainexsuite.com`
3. All subdomains share the session cookie
4. Each app checks auth state via AuthProvider
5. Protected routes redirect to login if unauthenticated

### AI Integration Pattern
- Each app has unique `systemPrompt` for specialized assistance
- Floating button (bottom-right corner)
- Chat interface with message history
- Calls `/api/ai/chat` → Cloud Function `chatWithGrok`
- Grok 4 API (128k context window)

### Database Structure (Firestore)
- Top-level collections with `ownerId` field
- User-scoped queries with `where('ownerId', '==', userId)`
- Real-time subscriptions where needed
- Optimized with composite indexes
